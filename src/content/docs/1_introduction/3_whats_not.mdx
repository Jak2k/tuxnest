description: Linux is not for everyone. Understand why.

Linux **might not be for everyone**. Here are some reasons why you might not want to use linux:

- Your hardware is supported or it's not. There is nothing like "driver installation". Most hardware is supported, but you should still check. This guide will come back to this point in a few chapters.
- Your software may not be available. Microsoft Office and the Adobe software for example are not available on linux. Luckily there are great alternatives. This guide will come back to this point too. Microsoft Office and Adobe software are both still available through your browser. Microsoft Teams is even available as linux app.
- There is less online support. Most [distros](../2_whats_linux#distributions-short-distros) have an online forum with helpful people, but most online magazins and tutorials are very Windows-centric.
- Because of the many different [distros](../2_whats_linux#distributions-short-distros), some tutorials you find for linux might not work on your distro. This guide is made for fedora with KDE Plasma.
- Many games' anti-cheat tools doesn't allow you to use linux, but most steam games are available for linux. You can check if your game is available for linux on the [proton website](https://www.protondb.com/).
- You can't execute `.exe` files.
