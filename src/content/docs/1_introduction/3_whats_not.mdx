title: What is Linux NOT?
description: Linux is not for everyone. Understand why.

Linux **may not be for everyone**. Here are some reasons why you might not want to use Linux:

- Your hardware may or may not be supported. There is no such thing as "driver installation". Most hardware is supported, but you should still check. This guide will address this in a few chapters.
- Your software may not be supported. For example, Microsoft Office and Adobe software are not available on Linux. Fortunately, there are great alternatives. This guide will return to this point as well. Microsoft Office and Adobe software are both still available through your browser. Microsoft Teams is even available as a Linux application.
- There is less online support. Most [distros](../2_whats_linux#distributions-short-distros) have an online forum with helpful people, but most online magazines and tutorials are very Windows-centric.
- Because of the many different [distros](../2_whats_linux#distributions-short-distros), some tutorials you find for Linux may not work for your distro. This guide is for Fedora with KDE Plasma.
- Some games' anti-cheat tools don't allow you to use linux, but most Steam games are available for linux. You can check if your game is available for linux on the [proton website](https://www.protondb.com/).
- You can't run `.exe` files.
