description: An Introduction to linux

Linux is the most popular operating system in the world. It is free and open source. It is also used in Android. Most websites run Linux behind the scenes. But it is also possible to use it on a personal computer.

## Why not use Windows?

- Windows costs over $100, and you just don't notice it because device manufacturers pay for it. But a computer without Windows costs less.
- Windows is slow. Because companies run their servers on Linux, it is a highly optimized operating system. Even Microsoft uses Linux to run its online services. So they have invested a lot of money in it. Amazon, Google, Meta and many other companies do the same.
- You can't know what Windows is doing on your computer. It's a closed system that can't be trusted.
- Windows is not very customizable. All existing solutions are somewhat hacky.
- Windows is really bloated. Many outdated and useless utilities are included.
- There is no official package manager. You have to install most software in an endless configuration dialog, and updates sometimes have to be done manually.
- Microsoft spies on you. They track and sell your information.
- Windows updates itself or changes your default browser to Microsoft Edge without your permission. Linux never does that.
- Windows is an old operating system. New versions still use the same system core as Windows 3.1!
- Windows 10 will be discontinued in a few years, and Windows 11 won't run on most older hardware. You need to buy a new computer, use Linux, or you could get hacked.

**Linux has none of these problems! It's *free*, super *customizable*, and you can even read its source code if you want!

## But what exactly is Linux?

It's an operating system core. It manages all the hardware and processes. There's no graphical interface.

## Desktop environments

There are several software suites that provide a graphical user interface for Linux. They are called desktop environments.

### Gnome

Gnome is a very well thought out and popular desktop environment, but it's very different from windows and you have to install 3rd party software to customize it. It is very minimalistic and doesn't have a taskbar by default.

### KDE Plasma (Recommended)

KDE Plasma is an extremely customizable (or kustomisable, how a KDE fan might pronounce it) desktop environment. It is also more beginner friendly for users who used Windows before. It has one taskbar (like windows), which is called panel, by default.

You shouldn't choose the distro by it's look. You should choose by it's package manager, maintainer, community and so on.

## Distributions (short: distros)

You need lots of software to use linux: A package manager, a terminal, a desktop environment, and some other software. There is also a constant debate which software is better. This is why distributions are so important.

Think of a distribution as a flavor of linux. It is packed with all the software you need to get started. They also configure everything for you so that everything plays nicely together.

### Debian

Debian is the mother of most Linux distributions, but it may **not be the best choice for beginners**. It is also quite old.

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a **very popular and beginner-friendly** distribution, but it is maintained by a company called Canonical. And this company sometimes makes **"Microsofty" decisions**. For example, they have **added a tiny advertisement** to an application called "Terminal". It is based on Debian and uses [Gnome](#gnome) as its desktop environment.

### Fedora (Recommended)

Fedora is a very popular Linux distribution. It's the most **modern** Linux distribution and is quite **beginner-friendly**. It is sponsored by Red Hat, a company that also makes an enterprise distribution based on Fedora. But it is much more community oriented than Ubuntu. It is available with many different desktop environments.

### And even more...

Arch, Manjaro, Kubuntu, Fedora Silverblue, Ubuntu Server, Endless OS, Zorin and many more.

## Conclusion

You could choose another distro, but I would **recommend Fedora with KDE Plasma**. It is super modern and still very beginner friendly. *This guide is for Fedora with KDE Plasma. If you want to use another distro, some things may not work or be different. If you want to use a different desktop environment, some things may look or work differently.
