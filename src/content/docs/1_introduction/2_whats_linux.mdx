title: What is linux?
description: An Introduction to linux

Linux is the most popular operating system in the world. It is free and open source. It is also used inside of android. Most websites use linux in the background. But it can also be used on a personal computer.

## Why not use windows?

- Windows cost over $100. You just don't notice because device manufacturers pay it for you, but a computer without windows is cheaper.
- Windows is slow. Linux is a highly optimized operating system, because companies run their servers on linux. Even Microsoft is running linux for their online services. Therefore they invested a lot of money on it. Amazon, Google, Meta, and many other companies do the same.
- You can't know what Windows does to your computer. It's a closed system that you can't trust.
- Windows isn't very customizable. All existing solutions are somewhat hacky.
- Windows is very bloated. It ships lots of outdated, useless utilities.
- There is no centralised package manager. You have to install most software in an endless configuration dialog.
- Microsoft spys on you. They are tracking and selling your data.
- Windows does updates or changes your default browser to Microsoft Edge, without your permission. Linux never does that.
- Windows is old. New versions still use the same system core as Windows 3.1!
- Windows 10 will be discontinued in a few years and Windows 11 doesn't run on most older hardware. You have to buy a new computer, use linux or you might get hacked.

**Linux doesn't have any of these problems!** It's *free*, super *customizable* and you can even read its source code, if you want!

## But what exactly is linux?

It's a operating system core. It manages all the hardware and processes. It doesn't have a graphical user interface by default.

## Desktop environments

There are multiple suits of software, that provide a graphical user interface for linux. They are called *desktop environments*.

### Gnome

Gnome is a very well thought out and popular desktop environment, but it's very different from windows and you have to install 3rd party software to customize it. It is very minimalistic and doesn't have a taskbar by default.

### KDE Plasma (Recommended)

KDE Plasma is an extremely customizable (or kustomisable, how a KDE fan might pronounce it) desktop environment. It is also more beginner friendly for users who used Windows before. It has one taskbar (like windows), which is called panel, by default.

:::tip

You shouldn't choose the distro by it's look. You should choose by it's package manager, maintainer, community and so on.

## Distributions (short: distros)

No. You need lots of software to use linux: A package manager, a terminal, a desktop environment, and some other software. There is also a constant debate which software is better. This is why distributions are so important.

Think of a distribution as a flavor of linux. It is packed with all the software you need to get started. They also configure everything for you so that everything plays nicely together.

### Debian

Debian is the mother of most linux distributions, but it may **not be the best choice for beginners**. It is quite old too.

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a **very popular and beginner friendly** distribution, but its maintainer is a company called Canonical. And this company sometimes makes **"*microsofty*" decisions**. For example, they **added a tiny add** in an app called "Terminal". It is based on Debian and uses [Gnome](#gnome) as desktop environment.

### Fedora (Recommended)

Fedora is a very popular linux distribution. It's the most **modern** linux distribution and is quite beginner friendly. It is sponsored by Red Hat, a company which makes a bussines linux. But it is much more community oriented than Ubuntu. It is available with many different desktop environments.

### And even more...

Arch, Manjaro, Kubuntu, Fedora Silverblue, Ubuntu Server, Endless OS, Zorin and many others.

## Conclusion

You could also choose another distro, but I would **recommend fedora with KDE Plasma**. It super modern and still very beginner friendly. This guide is made for fedora with KDE Plasma. If you want to use another distro, some things might not work or be different. If you want to use another desktop environment, some things might look or work differently.
